# DataVerse-Insurance_Claim_Prediction-Hackathon-AnalyticsVidhya

**1) About Hackathon:-**

An insurance policy is an agreement between a company and a customer by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage or illness in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

For example, you pay a premium of Rs. 3000/- each year for car insurance with a coverage of Rs. 100,000/-. Unfortunately, in case of an accident, the car is severely damaged. In that case, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of damage etc. for up to Rs. 100,000. 

Now if you are wondering how can a company bear such a high cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 3000/- per year only i.e. where the concept of probability comes into the picture. For example, there might be thousands of customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 3000 every year just like you, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would have had an accident that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.

Our client is an Insurance company that provides insurance for cars to its customers. In this hackathon, you will be closely working with the insurer in understanding the behaviour of the policyholders.

**2) Problem Statement:-**

CarIns is a startup that provides insurance for cars. It is one of the best car insurance brands known for the highest claim settlement ratio. It was launched back in Oct 2020 and acquired its initial policyholders by providing a hassle-free claim process, instant policy issuance, and claim settlements at minimum coverages.

As it's a fast growing startup, the company would like to optimize the cost of the insurance by identifying the policyholders who are more likely to claim in the next 6 months. 

Now the company would like to use Data Science to identify the policyholders whose chances of filing a claim are high in the next 6 months. The company challenges the Data Science community to build a high-performance algorithm to predict if the policyholder will file a claim in the next 6 months or not based on the set of car and policy features.

**3) About the Dataset:-**

You are provided with information on policyholders containing the attributes like policy tenure, age of the car, age of the car owner, population density of the city, make and model of the car, power, engine type, etc and the target variable indicating whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not.

**3.1) Data Dictionary:-**

You are provided with 3 files - train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv

**3.2) Train and Test Set:-**

The train and test set contains information about different insurance policy holders. The train set includes the target variable is_claim whereas in the test set, you need to predict the target variable is_claim.

**3.3) Submission File Format:-**

The solution file should follow a format similar to that of the sample submission file. sample_submission.csv contains 2 variables - policy_id and is_claim.

**4) Evaluation metric:-**

The evaluation metric for this hackathon would be F1 score.

**5) Public and Private Split:-**

Test data is further divided into Public (40%) and Private (60%) data.
Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data. The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over
